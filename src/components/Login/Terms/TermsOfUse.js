        </strong>
      </p>
      <p className="has-text-align-center">
        PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR
        LEGAL RIGHTS
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Federal Arbitration Act</strong>. The parties agree that
        these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration
        Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration
        provisions. To the extent state law applies, the law of the State of New
        York will govern.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>. Most disputes can be
        resolved without resort to litigation. The parties agree to use their
        best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement
        directly through consultation with ICC, and good faith negotiations
        shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or
        arbitration. For informal resolution, You agree to contact ICC’s support
        department at 888-ICC-SAFE (888-422-7233), or ICC may contact You using
        the last available information it has for you. This informal dispute
        resolution requirements is a prerequisite for any dispute, claim, or
        disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. Binding Arbitration</strong>. If the parties do not reach an
        agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time
        informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute
        Resolution provision above, then the parties agree to resolve by
        arbitration subject to the terms herein (unless an exception applies, as
        outlined below). Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to
        this Terms of Use (including its formation, performance, and breach),
        the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your download of,
        access to, or use of the Electronic Products shall be finally settled by
        binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS
        rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any
        rules or procedures governing or permitting className actions. The
        arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall
        have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or
        relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
        formation of this Terms of Use, including, but not limited to any claim
        that all or any part of this Terms of Use is void or voidable, or
        whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be
        empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under
        law or in equity, including public injunctive relief if You reside in
        California. The arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the
        parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, You must do the following: (A)
        Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim
        and the amount of damages You seek to recover. You may find a copy of a
        Demand for Arbitration at jamsadr.com; (B) Send three copies of the
        Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 620
        Eighth Ave. (NY Times Building), 34th Floor, New York, NY 10018; and (C)
        Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at 4051 Flossmoor Rd,
        Country Club Hills, IL 60478.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of
        filing a lawsuit in a court of applicable jurisdiction where You live,
        we will pay the difference between the applicable court filing and the
        arbitration filing fee. The arbitration rules also permit You to recover
        attorney's fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent
        this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and
        have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the
        costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right
        to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
      </p>
      <p>
        If You are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place
        at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for You
        or may take place by video or on the papers, if You so choose. For
        residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in
        the District of Columbia, United States of America, and You and we agree
        to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in
        the District of Columbia, United States of America in order to compel
        arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
        modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
        arbitrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. className Action Waiver</strong>. The parties further agree
        that the resolution of any disputes between the parties shall be
        conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a className
        action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive
        their right to file a className action or seek relief on a className
        basis.{" "}
        <strong>
          YOU AND ICC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
          YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR className
          MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED className OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any
          court or arbitrator determines that the className action waiver set
          forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or
          that an arbitration can proceed on a className basis, then the
          arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void
          in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to
          arbitrate disputes
        </strong>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A. Exception</strong>: Litigation of Intellectual Property
        Injunctive Relief and Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the
        parties' decision to resolve all disputes through initial dispute
        resolution or binding arbitration, either party may bring an action in
        state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to
        protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights”
        means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets,
        but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief
        in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that
        court's jurisdiction. Further, to extent that a breach of this Terms of
        Use may cause irreparable injury to ICC for which monetary damages would
        not be an adequate remedy, ICC shall be entitled to seek equitable
        relief from a court of competent jurisdiction without a bond, other
        security or proof of damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>B.</strong> <strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>. You have
        the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and className
        action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of
        your decision to opt out to marketing@iccsafe.org with the subject line,
        “ARBITRATION AND className ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be
        sent within thirty (30) days of (1) your first download of, access to,
        or use of the Electronic Products; or (2) notice to You by ICC of any
        material changes to this Section 15 regarding dispute resolution.
        Otherwise You shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with
        the terms of those paragraphs. If You opt out of these arbitration
        provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>C. Changes to this Section</strong>. ICC will provide 30-days'
        notice of any material changes to this section. Changes will become
        effective on the 30th day, and will apply prospectively only to any
        claims arising after the 30th (unless You opt-out as permitted above).
        If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to
        this Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be
        severed from the Section entitled Arbitration and className Action
        Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Arbitration
        and className Action Waiver (or similarly named) section in existence
        after You first downloaded, accessed, or used the Application.

        <li>

        <li>
          in the event of any claim by a third party that your possession or use

          to you in relation to that claim;
